        <h2>Who are you?</h2>

        <p>
            Aside from what is on the front page, my name is Cariad or just "Cari" to a lot of my friends.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many people on the Internet know me from the cyber security field. I've been working in the field formally 
            for over a decade, but I've had an interest in computer security since I was a child. What got me into all 
            this was Cliff Stoll's book, <em>The Cuckoo's Egg</em> (ISBN: 0-385-24946-2), which is based on the true story 
            of Stoll's adventure in catching KGB-sponsored hackers breaking into US government computers. It gave me 
            the inspiration to go into digital forensics/incident response (DFIR), which then led to me going into 
            security engineering. I now oversee a cyber security team which handles logging and automation.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've spoken at a number of information security conferences, have been interviewed by the media on security 
            topics, and have been a contributor to a number of publications. Much of my work has been focused on data 
            analytics, primarily in logging, with my biggest achievement in processing breach data from an unorganized 
            mess into a predictable structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            Right now, I am back in university, completing a computing science degree. This has been a life goal since I 
            left post-secondary education to work in my field. It is not an easy task as I am continuing to work 
            fulltime as I do this.
        </p>

        <p>
            My career does not define me of course, and outside of computer security I have an avid interest in a 
            lot of things including speedrunning video games, cycling, roller skating (I briefly had a stint playing 
            roller derby), watching anime, camping, photography, vegetarian cooking, and travelling. I also like to 
            make cryptographic puzzles when I have the time to make them and I love to share them for everyone to try 
            and defeat.
        </p>

        <p>
            I identify as a queer woman and am a lesbian. Much of the way I approach my life has been through the lens 
            of intersectional feminism. Being that I am a white woman, I must make a lot of space for other folk who 
            face systemic issues that I do not endure. I sincerely believe in building equity for all persons as it is 
            beneficial to everyone if everyone is able to live to their full potential.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've spent most of my life living in Vancouver, although for a time I was living in elsewhere in Canada. 
            I've been to many parts of the world, which has been a privilege that I wish many more could have.
