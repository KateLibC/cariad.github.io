            The only things NFTs have given us are shitty monkey images, hexagons on Twitter, and 
            an ever-increasing amount of carbon dioxide emitted into our atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p> 
            You cannot be for fighting climate change all the while churning away computer 
            processing power on something which has no physical analogue or genuine purpose other 
            than showing off wealth. Your NFT is in an essence a goddamn hyperlink and nothing 
            more.

            They're just modern-day Pogs--at least with them they can be recycled or melted down 
            into something useful. Even the creator of NFTs,
            <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/">Anil Dash</a>
            has disowned them.

            If you want to support artists, commission them or don't buy knock-off products.
