  <title>When Stadium-Chinatown station also had monorail</title>

<p>Plaza of Nations at Expo 86 (City of Vancouver Archives)</p>

<p>Expo 86 was Vancouver’s “coming out” party and its theme was transportation. This of course coincided with the opening of what is now the Expo Line from Waterfront to its then terminus at New Westminster. However, there were a few rapid transit systems built for the exposition including one very useful monorail system.</p>

The entire length of the service spanned over five kilometres and it was vital in not only connecting the parts of the False Creek portion of the fair, but also back to SkyTrain itself which was a link to the Canada Pavilion at what is now Canada Place, next to Waterfront station.</p>
