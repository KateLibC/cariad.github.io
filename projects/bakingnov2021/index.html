        <p>
            I had been wanting to do a baking stream for quite a long time. These are the recipes from my first-ever 
            stream of baking anything on the channel!
        </p>

        <p>
            The recipes were sourced from various places and you are free to use them for yourself. I have converted 
            the volume measurements to metric weight where required.
        </p>

        <h3>Substitutions for vegans and gluten-free</h3>

        <p>
            If you are vegan (I am formerly and am now vegetarian), you can replace the following ingredients with 
            their vegan equivalent just fine (these are my suggestions based on experience):
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Non-vegan</th>
                <th>Vegan</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Butter</td>
                <td>Vegan margarine</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Egg</td>
                <td>Flax egg (<a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/how-to-make-a-flax-egg/">recipe</a>) or powdered egg substitute</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Milk</td>
                <td>Oat creamer</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Condensed milk</td>
                <td>Coconut milk + sugar (<a href="https://www.karissasvegankitchen.com/vegan-sweetened-condensed-milk/">recipe</a>)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            There is one recipe where I cannot provide substitution suggestions, but it affects the secret recipe and 
            unfortunately cannot be done one-to-one.
        </p>

        <p>
            I make mention of Bird's custard powder and it does not list any ingredients that are non-vegan. However, this 
            may be regional and it does indicate on the label that it may contain milk. There are vegan custard powders 
            available if this is of concern.
        </p>

        <p>
            Chocolate chips are available in vegan options and are quite suitable for these recipes.
        </p>

        <p>
            As for gluten-free, I have had zero issues with these ingredients being replaced with either premade or 
            flours that market themselves as "one-to-one". Naturally they do behave differently and could produce results 
            unlike what I am making here, but they should still taste great!

        <h3>Magic Cookie Bars</h3>

        </p>

        <p>
            These have multiple names, but I am more familiar with "Monster Bar", which is used all over Montr√©al.
        </p>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>

        <p>
            Preheat oven to 175 C (350 F).
        </p>

        <p>
            You will need the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Medium-sized bowl</li>
            <li>Baking pan (lined with parchment paper)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <p>
            I don't believe that you absolutely require any specific type of chocolate chips or if the 
            butter should be salted or unsalted. However, I would avoid adding too many sweet things as 
            the condensed milk itself will be quite sweet.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you want to add some chocolate flare, Oreo crumbs may also be a good substitute for the 
            graham crackers!
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Quantity</th>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>110 g (1/2 cup)</td>
                <td>Unsalted butter (melted)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>180 g (1 1/2 cup)</td>
                <td>Graham Cracker Crumbs</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>170 g (1 cup)</td>
                <td>Semi-sweet chocolate chips*</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>100 g (1 1/2 cup)</td>
                <td>Flaked, sweetened coconut shreds</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>410 mL (14 oz)</td>
                <td>Sweetened condensed milk</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            * You can replace half with butterscotch or peanut butter chips!
        </p>

        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix butter and graham crackers together in a bowl</li>
            <li>Pour into a prepared pan and press down with oiled hands</li>
            <li>Sprinkle chocolate chips and then coconut atop of crumbs</li>
            <li>Pour condensed milk evenly over the coconut</li>
            <li>Bake for 25 minutes</li>
            <li>Cool for 10 minutes before cutting into bars</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Nanaimo Bars</h3>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
            This is probably Canada's most revered desert!
        </p>

        <p>
            Be careful with how you proportion this recipe. One time, The New York Times published a piece 
            where they had the layers so disproprotionate that it enraged us Canadians to the point where even 
            I went and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMJCq8UB5R3/">baked some myself</a> in protest.
        </p>

        <p>
            They took the response <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/world/canada/Nanaimo-Bar-Outrage-Canada.html">
            with some sort of retort</a> at least.
        </p>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>

        <p>
            No need to use the oven here as you will be only melting chocolate into melted butter and preparing the custard in a pot.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will need the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>9" x 11" (23 x 28 cm) baking pan lined with parchment</li>
            <li>Medium pan for bottom layer</li>
            <li>Medium bowl for middle layer</li>
            <li>Medium pan to make chocolate layer</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <p>
            After you complete the middle layer, you can use the waiting time as an opportunity to clean 
            up any pans you have used.

        <ul>
            <li>Bottom layer</li>

                <li>Remove from heat, whisk in egg until thickened (about 30 seconds)</li>
                <li>Add graham crumbs, coconut, and walnuts by stirring</li>

        <p>
            This is a cookie served at a local Mexican chain. It's really delicious and has quite a bite!
        </p>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>

        <p>
            Pre-heat oven to 190 C (375 F).
        </p>

        <p>
            You will need the following:

        <ul>
            <li>Two baking sheets</li>
            <li>Two medium mixing bowls</li>

            </tr>

                <td>Salt</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><em>As desired</em></td>
                <td>Sugar</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            * Typically canola is used, but olive and avocado are fine. I would avoid coconut oil however.<br />
            ** If you use ginger root, use the tablespoon measurement, but if the juice, use volume.
        </p>

        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix dry ingredients in a bowl</li>
            <li>In another bowl, mix wet ingredients</li>
            <li>Combine the two bowls and mix together</li>
            <li>On a baking sheet, press fist-sized dough balls out and sprinkle with salt and sugar</li>
            <li>Bake for 11 minutes or until cookies appear to crack</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Cookies will be fudgy in the middle and you should get about 12 big ones if you use the fist-sized method--there 
            should be no issue with reducing the size of the cookies when pressing.
        </p>
