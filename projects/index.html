        <p>
            Often I am pretty scattered about my projects. Here, you'll find what I've worked on plus maybe details on other projects 
            I have since retired. This page won't be updated too often.

                I baked some treats on Twitch for my usual audience! It was a lot of fun and was the first time I had a stream done 
                entirely from my kitchen. It was a lot of fun and I plan to do more of these.

                <a href="/projects/nessnescontroller/">Converting a third-party NES controller to work on a SNES</a>
            </h3>

            <span id="date">June 2021</span>

            <p>
                A friend was looking for cursed controller to play Super Mario World on her Super Nintendo. I had a third-party NES 
                clone gifted to me with two awful controllers, so I decided to repurpose one for her SNES. It was expected that this 
                controller would be complete garbage to play with, but apparently you can complete the game even with missing a 
                critical function in the game.

                This is an export from draw.io which shows the most efficient route to take when speedrunning Mario is Missing, a weird 
                edutainment game released for the Super Nintendo.
