  <title>Ghosts: Connaught Hill</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Approximate location of the former station, Connaught Hill (Google Street View) When riding down the Expo Line from Edmonds to 22nd Street, one may notice that it is a rather lengthy ride. At nearly 2 KM, it’s nowhere near the longest distance between stations, but when it was the interurban Central Park Line, there was a station in-between the two. The BC Electric Railway (BCER) had a station around what is now 9th Avenue in Burnaby or simply situated south of a SkyTrain maintenance facility. Connaught Hill, named after after the western province of Ireland named Connaught, was a small station serving the now-residential area straddling the Burnaby and New Westminster border. Station location in New Westminster (Google) Back then, it was a large gravel pit. The hole created conveniently ended up becoming the SkyTrain maintenance facility we have today. Connaught Hill as it appeared in the 1950s (TransLink / BC Transit) Today, there sits no station but you can visit its old location when travelling along the BC Parkway. Stopped to take a photo as I cycled on by. You can see the remnants of the old tracks left behind.">

<p>Approximate location of the former station, Connaught Hill (Google Street View)</p>

<p>When riding down the Expo Line from Edmonds to 22nd Street, one may notice that it is a rather lengthy ride. At nearly 2 KM, it’s nowhere near the longest distance between stations, but when it was the interurban Central Park Line, there was a station in-between the two.</p>

<p>The BC Electric Railway (BCER) had a station around what is now 9th Avenue in Burnaby or simply situated south of a SkyTrain maintenance facility. Connaught Hill, named after after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Ireland">western province of Ireland named Connaught</a>, was a small station serving the now-residential area straddling the Burnaby and New Westminster border.</p>
